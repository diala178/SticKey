# SticKey - The Sticker App
we wanted to create a simple backend development for an e-commerce application that sells a virtual product: WhatsApp and messages stickers. 
The goal was to use the CRUD operations, where a customer (user) would choose a sticker, add it to the cart, delete it from the cart if wanted, and then check out the order.

## App Statement 
An E-commerce application to buy stickers for keyboard messages.

## Features
1- View Sticker (GET)
2- User click on sticker to view status (GET)
3-Choose status (PUT)
4-add to shopping cart (POST)
5- Delete sticker from shopping cart (Delete)
